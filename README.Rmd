boundaries is a utility package for the euclid ecosystem providing tools for 
working (primarily) with polygon boundaries. Offsetting/insetting and 
simplification are among the primary algorithms provided by this package, but it
serves as the place for any function used to somehow alter or do calculations on
the polygonal rings

## Installation

You can install the development version of boundaries like so:

``` r
pak::pkg_install("thomasp85/boundaries")
```

## Example
Below we show how to simplify a complex polygon, by reducing the number of 
vertices to a tenth of the original count:

```{r}
library(boundaries)
denmark <- polyclid::denmark()

sum(cardinality(denmark))
```

```{r}
denmark_simple <- simplify_poly(
  denmark, 
  stop = "below count ratio", 
  stop_threshold = 0.1
)
sum(cardinality(denmark_simple))
```

As can be seen the simplified polygon retains its features quite well

```{r}
plot(denmark)
euclid_plot(denmark_simple, lty = 2, border = "red")
```

Offsetting and insetting can be calculated either based on the straight skeleton
which retains the vertex angles, or using minkowski sum with a disc which 
introduces rounding of obtuse angles. Here we show insetting and offsetting with
minkowski

```{r}
plot(denmark)

inset <- minkowski_offset(denmark, -0.05, arc_segments = 10)
euclid_plot(inset, lty = 2)

offset <- minkowski_offset(denmark, 0.1, arc_segments = 10)
euclid_plot(union(offset), border = "red")
```

There are more functions provided in the packages. Explore the docs to learn
